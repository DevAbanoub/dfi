# Contributing to DFI

Thank you for at least considering contributing time and effort to DFI! It's awesome that you think it's worth your time.

## How should I make my PR?
The project is organized so that `master` contains the current version that builds and works (mostly) as intended. `develop` contains the current WIP changes. Please make all PRs against the `develop` branch, or a branch specifically for the issue/PR. 

## I have an issue I want to work on
That's great! Just leave a comment on the issue so we know that you want to dedicate time to it, that way nobody else will take it up either.

## I want to help, but I don't know what I can do.
First of all, if you don't have any specific ideas, check out the [issues](https://github.com/wjh/dfi/issues). There may well be something there that catches your eye, and fixing anything would be much appreciated.

Anything labeled "easy" requires minimal knowledge of how DFI works to fix (as far as I know.)

If you need further clarification or guidance on what that would involve, just ask! I'd rather you didn't waste your time.

If you can't code, you can still help! DFI always needs testing, and guides/documentation is always great.

## I think I have found a bug.
Check the issues, if it hasn't already been reported, then go ahead! Please include the version of DFI you are running, as many details about your system as possible, as well as all commands/actions you did that lead to the bug occuring. If it was an error, then please include *any* errors and stack traces that occured. Steps to replicate the bug would be much appreciated.

Even if I haven't mentioned it, include as much detail as you possibly can. The more detail you provide, the more likely it is it can be fixed.

## I've made your code more pretty!
While cosmetic fixes are nice, if you're just adjusting the odd bit of whitespace here and there, your commit probably won't get merged. However, if you significantly contribute to improving the clarity of the code, or otherwise make things look better, then go ahead!

## I have an awesome idea
If this is the case, just create a new issue! It'll probably be discussed a bit, and if others think it is awesome too, then you'll get the go-ahead.

## I've made something cool for DFI
Feel free to make a PR to add it to the README :)
